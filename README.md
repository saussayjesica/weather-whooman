# Weather Whooman
Search the weather in any city with weather whooman....whoo! 

This was a small weekend project to practice using API's. The code consists of HTML, CSS, Javascript. I have used the Google Maps API to find the latitude and longitude of the city chosen by the user. I then use the Open Weather Map API to get the current weather details for the selected city.
